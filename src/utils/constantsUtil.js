      and informative way to browse and search the research datasets they need. I developed this web aplication based on the Open \
      Source Platform - <a href="http://ckan.org/" target="_blank">CKAN</a>. The web infrastructure is built on Python, Pylons web \
      framework, and Jinja2 templating language. The database is designed using PostgreSQL and accessed using SQLAlchemy. \
      The front-end website is customized using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.'

      on efficient Image Processing techniques and Machine Learning methods, our goal is to design a diagnostic support tool for \
      retinal dystrophy based on a database of imaging, history and clinical findings and validated algorithms to identify likely \
      outcomes/diagnosis. Such a tool would assist ophthalmologists located globally in clinical diagnosis and selection of \
      genetic testing. Upon entering a patientâ€™s symptoms (such as age of onset, type of vision loss, chronicity), pertinent \
      history (especially regarding affected family members), examination findings and imaging, the tool would compute a likely \
      diagnosis.'

    "description": 'Final project for UMICH <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/498IR/" target="_blank">Information \
      Retrieval and Web Search Course</a>. In this project, we built an \
      efficient text classifier to automatically predict the owned car brand based on the twitter user\'s relevant tweets. \
      Using <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation" target="_blank">Twitter API</a> and \
      <a href="http://www.tweepy.org/" target="_blank">tweepy package</a> in Python, we crawled and created a dataset containing \
      tweets from thousands of Twitter user samples together. Each user sample is manually labeled with the car brand based on \
      the information from their tweets. Three prediction model - Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM(Support Vector Machine) \
      classifiers are built to learn the information pattern from the dataset. Based on the dataset and prediction performance, we \
      also perform Words Frequency Analysis and Linguistic Analysis to analyze the underlying user habits and dominant words for \
      each car brand. Code, report and documentation are available<a href="https://github.com/StephenWeiXu/PredictYourCarBrand" target="_blank"> here</a>.'
