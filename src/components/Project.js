				"description": 'I worked on this project as a Software Developer Intern at <a href="http://cci.med.umich.edu/" target="_blank"> \
					University of Michigan Health System - Cancer Center Informatics</a> for 4 months. The project goal is to collect and publish \
					the meatdata of research datasets across departments in University of Michigan Health System to provide researchers a convinent \
					and informative way to browse and search the research datasets they need. I developed this web aplication based on the Open \
					Source Platform - <a href="http://ckan.org/" target="_blank">CKAN</a>. The web infrastructure is built on Python, Pylons web \
					framework, and Jinja2 templating language. The database is designed using PostgreSQL and accessed using SQLAlchemy. \
					The front-end website is customized using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.'

				"description": 'I participated in this project as a team member of Machine Learning group, conducted \
					by <a href="http://www.kellogg.umich.edu/" target="_blank"><i>Kellogg Eye Center(KEC)</i></a> of University of Michigan. Based \
					on efficient Image Processing techniques and Machine Learning methods, our goal is to design a diagnostic support tool for \
					retinal dystrophy based on a database of imaging, history and clinical findings and validated algorithms to identify likely \
					outcomes/diagnosis. Such a tool would assist ophthalmologists located globally in clinical diagnosis and selection of \
					genetic testing. Upon entering a patientâ€™s symptoms (such as age of onset, type of vision loss, chronicity), pertinent \
					history (especially regarding affected family members), examination findings and imaging, the tool would compute a likely \
					diagnosis.'

				"description": 'This is the final project for UMICH <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/498IR/" target="_blank">EECS \
					inter 2015 Special Topics 498-001</a>(<i><b>Information Retrieval and Web Search</b></i>). In this project, we built an \
					efficient text classifier to automatically predict the owned car brand based on the twitter user\'s relevant tweets. \
					Using <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation" target="_blank">Twitter API</a> and \
					<a href="http://www.tweepy.org/" target="_blank">tweepy package</a> in Python, we crawled and created a dataset containing \
					tweets from thousands of Twitter user samples together. Each user sample is manually labeled with the car brand based on \
					the information from their tweets. Three prediction model - Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM(Support Vector Machine) \
					classifiers are built to learn the information pattern from the dataset. Based on the dataset and prediction performance, we \
					also perform Words Frequency Analysis and Linguistic Analysis to analyze the underlying user habits and dominant words for \
					each car brand. Code, report and documentation are available<a href="https://github.com/StephenWeiXu/PredictYourCarBrand" target="_blank"> here</a>.'

					paper <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2238208.2238211" target="_blank"><i>Assistive text reading from complex \
