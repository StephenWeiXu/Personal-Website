							I worked on this project as a Software Developer Intern at <a href="http://cci.med.umich.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Michigan Health System - Cancer Center Informatics</a> for 4 months. The project goal is to collect and publish the meatdata of research datasets across departments in University of Michigan Health System to provide researchers a convinent and informative way to browse and search the research datasets they need.
							I developed this web aplication based on the Open Source Platform - <a href="http://ckan.org/" target="_blank">CKAN</a>. The web infrastructure is built on Python, Pylons web framework, and Jinja2 templating language. The database is designed using PostgreSQL and accessed using SQLAlchemy. The front-end website is customerized using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

							</div>
							I participated in this project as a team member of Machine Learning group, conducted by <a href="http://www.kellogg.umich.edu/" target="_blank"><i>Kellogg Eye Center(KEC)</i></a> of University of Michigan. Based on efficient Image Processing techniques and Machine Learning methods, our goal is to design a diagnostic support tool for retinal dystrophy based on a database of imaging, history and clinical findings and validated algorithms to identify likely outcomes/diagnosis.

							Such a tool would assist ophthalmologists located globally in clinical diagnosis and selection of genetic testing. Upon entering a patientâ€™s symptoms (such as age of onset, type of vision loss, chronicity), pertinent history (especially regarding affected family members), examination findings and imaging, the tool would compute a likely diagnosis.

							This is the final project for UMICH <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/498IR/" target="_blank">EECS Winter 2015 Special Topics 498-001</a>(<i><b>Information Retrieval and Web Search</b></i>). In this project, we built an efficient text classifier to automatically predict the owned car brand based on the twitter user's relevant tweets. Using <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation" target="_blank">Twitter API</a> and <a href="http://www.tweepy.org/" target="_blank">tweepy package</a> in Python, we crawled and created a dataset containing tweets from thousands of Twitter user samples together. Each user sample is manually labeled with the car brand based on the information from their tweets. Three prediction model - Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM(Support Vector Machine) classifiers are built to learn the information pattern from the dataset. Based on the dataset and prediction performance, we also perform Words Frequency Analysis and Linguistic Analysis to analyze the underlying user habits and dominant words for each car brand.

							</div>
							This is a project for my graduation thesis of senior year in Tianjin University. The goal is to detect text strings in natrual scene images based on Adaboost Learning method and structural analysis according to the paper <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2238208.2238211" target="_blank"><i>Assistive text reading from complex background for blind persons</i></a>. My <a href="Project/Text_Detection/TextDetection.pdf"><i>graduation thesis</i></a>(Chinese version) based on this project won <i>Excellent Graduation Paper prize</i> from the university.

							The text detection algorithm is trained and evaluated on <a href="http://algoval.essex.ac.uk/icdar/Datasets.html" target="_blank"><i>Robust Reading Datasets</i></a> provided by <a href="http://algoval.essex.ac.uk/icdar/Competitions.html" target="_blank"><i>ICDAR 2003 Competitions</i></a>. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can successfully localize and extract the text information in natural scene images with satisfactory performance.
