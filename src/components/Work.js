					retinal dystrophy based on a database of imaging, history and clinical findings and validated algorithms to identify likely \
					outcomes/diagnosis. Such a tool would assist ophthalmologists located globally in clinical diagnosis and selection of \
					genetic testing. Upon entering a patientâ€™s symptoms (such as age of onset, type of vision loss, chronicity), pertinent \
					history (especially regarding affected family members), examination findings and imaging, the tool would compute a likely \

					Retrieval and Web Search Course</a>. In this project, we built an \
					efficient text classifier to automatically predict the owned car brand based on the twitter user\'s relevant tweets. \
					Using <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation" target="_blank">Twitter API</a> and \
					<a href="http://www.tweepy.org/" target="_blank">tweepy package</a> in Python, we crawled and created a dataset containing \
					tweets from thousands of Twitter user samples together. Each user sample is manually labeled with the car brand based on \
					the information from their tweets. Three prediction model - Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM(Support Vector Machine) \
					classifiers are built to learn the information pattern from the dataset. Based on the dataset and prediction performance, we \
					also perform Words Frequency Analysis and Linguistic Analysis to analyze the underlying user habits and dominant words for \
					each car brand. Code, report and documentation are available<a href="https://github.com/StephenWeiXu/PredictYourCarBrand" target="_blank"> here</a>.'
